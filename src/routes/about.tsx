        Toni Lima is a ceramic artist based in Portland Oregon, creating playful,
        functional pottery carved with whimsical creatures. Her colorful,
        story-driven carvings add mischief and narrative to everyday forms; her
        stoneware pieces are made to support the small rituals of daily life; and
        her work in porcelain and black clay explores contrast, form, and
        surface. Toni came to ceramics in 2021 after 15 years as a public school
        special education teacher, where she also trained other educators. She’s
        always been drawn to hands-on work—whether teaching, carving clay, or
        picking up the occasional shift in a restaurant kitchen—pulled by the
        satisfaction of making food and making things. Her practice is shaped by
        curiosity, collaboration, and the belief that pottery should be used,
        enjoyed, and smiled at.

        I’m drawn to ceramics for the balance it demands—between planning and
        improvising, precision and unpredictability. My studio practice reflects
        the rhythms of my life: focused, hands-on, and often a bit of creative
        chaos. Each piece I make is rooted in utility or story (and sometimes
        both), shaped by a love of working with clay and a firm belief that even
        your cereal bowl deserves a little personality. I believe pottery should
        be touched, used, and enjoyed. But most of all, it should make you smile.
